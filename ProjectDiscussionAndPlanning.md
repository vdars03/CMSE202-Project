## Project Planning

Now that you've had a chance to think about how you will work together as a group, it's time to start thinking about how you will plan your project to make sure you meet your project goals.

&#9989; **Do This:** To start, spend some time thinking about the various roles that might be needed in order for your project to meet its goals. For example, you might want:

* someone to be in charge of sending our reminders for group meetings and reserving a space to meet or setting up a zoom room

* someone to periodically test your project code to ensure that it is still working as intended and reporting issues as they arise (GitHub has an issue tracking feature!)
* someone to take the lead in developing the project presentation slides (e.g. setting up a shared slide deck, building an outline, indicating who is responsible for which part, etc.)
* and so on... (*you should take these as suggestions and come up with the list of roles that make sense to you and your group!*)

You may find it useful to review the project requirements page on tue course website to make sure you all know what's expected of your and it might help with identifying important roles to have within your group: https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse202-F23-jb/course_materials/CMSE202_FinalProjectRequirementsAndGradingRubric.html 

If someone is missing from your group, its OK to assign them a role during this class session, but make sure to make contact with them to ensure that they are OK with taking on this role or if they think they would be an asset to the group in another way.

<font size=+3>&#9998;</font> Record the project roles you've identified for your group and who is going to take on that role in the `ProjectDiscussionAndPlanning.md` file in your repo, but feel free to drop any important notes here as well, if that would be helpful.


* Finding data sets
* Plotting data sets
* Simulating data sets
* Describing plots and simulations
* Drawing a conclusion
* Stating a solution
* Preesenting the project

Roles will be taken up in order of interest during the intervals of time 

&#9989; **Do This:** Now that you've determined the role(s) each of you will take in supporting your project, you're going to try to identify some short-term project goals that you can use to help you stay on track.  For example, you might want to:

* Have usable data or a chosen model you're going to use (or both) by next week

* Have a working proof-of-concept by the middle of November
* Have first-draft versions of key data visualizations before Thanksgiving break
* and so on... (*again, these are just random suggestions, you should choose things that align with your overall project goals and map to a realistic timeline*)

You may want to revisit the [project requirements and grading rubric](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse202-F23-jb/course_materials/CMSE202_FinalProjectRequirementsAndGradingRubric.html) and, as a reminder, you're expected to give a project progress update presentation during the Day 23 class session. For reference, the course schedule is here: https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse202-F23-jb/course_materials/CMSE202_Calendar.html

It would be really great to have a complete project draft by Day 23!

**Record at least three short-term project goals with target deadlines in the markdown cell below.** You may also wish to include who in the group will be working on each goal.

<font size=+3>&#9998;</font> Record the project goals and corresponding deadlines that you've identified for your group and who is going to work on each goal in the `ProjectDiscussionAndPlanning.md` file in your repo, but feel free to drop any important notes here as well, if that would be helpful.

* Finding and cleaning the right dataset
* Clearly defining project goals
* Stating timeline for each aspect of the project

Roles taken up based on interest and availablility during discussions

&#9989; **Do This:** Finally, before moving on to set up your project repository, **set a day, time, and (if possible) as location for your first group project meeting (you can always just use Zoom for this).** 

Make sure everyone in the group is available at this time and that you have a way to contact each if something comes up.  If you can't find a time that works for everyone, try to find a time that works for most people and then make sure to record the meeting or take detailed notes so that anyone who can't make it can still get caught up.

<font size=+3>&#9998;</font> Record the day, time, and location of your first group meeting in the `ProjectDiscussionAndPlanning.md` file in your repo, but feel free to drop any important notes here as well, if that would be helpful.
